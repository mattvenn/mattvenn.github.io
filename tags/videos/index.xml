      <description>In this interview I talk with Diego Hernando about their ASIC submission.
They have been working on some analog blocks; mostly op-amps but also including a PLL from another designer.
We discuss the difference between digital and analog design, the tools, simulation, layout and testing.

      <description>In this interview I talk with Arya Reais-Parsi about their shuttle submission. They are working with a group of students to create Open Source FPGA fabric that can be put on an ASIC and configured with yosys/nextpnr.

      <description>In this interview I talk with Sylvain &amp;lsquo;tnt&amp;rsquo; Munaut about his Google/Skywater ASIC application.
The design is especially interesting to me because of the way it merges the SRAM blocks with the logic. This has been a major challenge in my own design.

      <description>In this interview I talk with Vladimir Milovanović about putting a spectrometer on the Google/Skywater/Efabless ASIC shuttle.
He created the design using Chisel.

      <title>Inverter</title>

      <description>A standard cell is a building block that contains some basic digital or analogue functionality. These blocks are then tiled together to make the final design.
Since finding out about the Skywater PDK, I wanted to try drawing my own &amp;lsquo;standard cell&amp;rsquo; using the Skywater transistor models.
An inverter is one of the simplest and even that was quite difficult! As you can see below it contains an N and P type MOSFET.</description>
