      <description>In this interview I talk with Sylvain &amp;lsquo;tnt&amp;rsquo; Munaut about his Google/Skywater ASIC application.
The design is especially interesting to me because of the way it merges the SRAM blocks with the logic. This has been a major challenge in my own design.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the link to the repository

      <description>A standard cell is a building block that contains some basic digital or analogue functionality. These blocks are then tiled together to make the final design.
Since finding out about the Skywater PDK, I wanted to try drawing my own &amp;lsquo;standard cell&amp;rsquo; using the Skywater transistor models.
An inverter is one of the simplest and even that was quite difficult! As you can see below it contains an N and P type MOSFET.</description>
