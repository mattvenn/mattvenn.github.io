      <description>This is one of the first projects I hardened using OpenLane
It shows the time on an LCD panel. It will be part of my first tapeout After running the OpenLane ASIC flow, it results in a design that uses 180x180 microns (32000 square microns). As we have about 10e6 square microns in the user project area of the Google shuttle, I could potentially put about 300 of these on the ASIC!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Zero to ASIC multi project harness.
The Google/Skywater Shuttle has about 10 square mm of space for your project. This sounds tiny but is actually HUGE for many beginner projects. Read this post to find out what you could fit in the user space.
For the Zero to ASIC course, I want to aggregate all your designs together into that area, so we need to do some extra bits:</description>

      <description>A standard cell is a building block that contains some basic digital or analogue functionality. These blocks are then tiled together to make the final design.
Since finding out about the Skywater PDK, I wanted to try drawing my own &amp;lsquo;standard cell&amp;rsquo; using the Skywater transistor models.
An inverter is one of the simplest and even that was quite difficult! As you can see below it contains an N and P type MOSFET.</description>
